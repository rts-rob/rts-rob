# Rob Sutter

I help engineers help engineers.

I recently took ownership of an understaffed service suffering from repeated high-impact outages, hired and developed a completely new team, and established a culture of operational excellence, taking the service from a laggard to a leader in operational stability initiatives, all while doubling traffic to the service every four months. The team now ships customer-facing features and performance optimisations multiple times each week and has delivered a 20x reduction in latency in the hot path.
